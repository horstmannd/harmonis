<p class="about">

Harmonis specializes in handmade batik, which is cloth made from a wax-resistant dyeing technique.<br /><br />

First, a design is sketched. The design is then made into a brass or wood stamp. The most basic batik requires a two-step process. First, the cotton cloth is dyed the color desired for the design itself, for example, green. Once the cloth dries from the first dyeing process, hot wax is applied to the stamp then pressed onto the dyed cloth. Then, the cloth is dyed in the color desired for the background, for example, black. Once the cloth dries, the wax is washed off. The batik is now completed with a black background and a green design.<br /><br />

If more colors and designs are desired, the same process would be repeated. Sometimes two or three wax coated stamps are applied onto the cloth. The area where the two stamps overlap will introduce an additional shade to the piece, increasing its sophistication and beauty. This aspect of batik, or wax-resistant dyeing technique, is what makes it so enchanting. Wax dyed cloth is comparable to a painting, composed of layer upon layers of designs, colors and strokes. Batik can be styled in various ways, it can be abstract or realistic, modern or classic, it just depends on your own personal style.
